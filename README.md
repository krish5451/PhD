## Hyperparameter Tuning of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Model for Structural Damage Prediction

This project is part of my Ph.D. work, where I focus on predicting structural damage based on data collected from probability analysis. The hyperparameter tuning of an ANN model using Keras Tuner and TensorFlow is showcased. The repository contains the code, data, and methodology for creating and optimizing the ANN model.

### Key Features:

- **Prediction Task:** Predicting structural damage using data collected from probability analysis.
- **Data Collection:** The data collection for this project is based on my previously published research article, which can be referred to using the following DOI: [10.1061/(ASCE)SC.1943-5576.0000708](https://ascelibrary.org/doi/10.1061/%28ASCE%29SC.1943-5576.0000708)
- **Data Preprocessing:** Loading and preprocessing data from an Excel file, including feature scaling using `StandardScaler`.
- **Model Building:** Creating a Sequential ANN model using Keras, with the flexibility to define the number of layers and units.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilizing `RandomSearch` from Keras Tuner to optimize hyperparameters like learning rate, activation functions, and the number of units in each layer.
- **Model Evaluation:** [Add details about evaluation metrics and techniques used in the project.]

### Dependencies:

- Keras Tuner
- TensorFlow
- pandas
- scikit-learn

### Usage:

To run the code, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   !pip3 install keras-tuner
   !pip3 install tensorflow
   ```
2. Rest of the code can be run in the Google co-lab or VS code
